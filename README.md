# currencyConverter

# Overview

I have created a currency converter application that converts between different currencies based on exchange rates.

I wrote this software to help me run calcuations between USD and EUR for my business in Portugal.

# Development Environment

I developed this software in VSCode using Javascript and ExchangeRate-API

# Useful Websites

- [ExchangeRate-API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com)
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/first-steps)

# Future Work

- I'd like to add a dashboard that shows some common exhanges and automatically updates them
- I'd like to improve the overall look of the webpage using CSS
